    Floating Elements

    Floated elements should always come first in the
    mark-up order. As floating elements need something
    to 'wrap around' and content may not visually lay out
    in the 'correct' way if located after the content it is
    supposed to wrap.

    Floating elements are also considered block level elements,
    so a separate declaration of display: block, is redundant.

    If a parent element only contains floated elements, then the
    parent element will have a computed height of zero.

    If a parent element has unfloated content, and floated content
    that is taller than the unfloated content, then the parent
    element will only have a height equal to the unfloated content.

    Give the parent element a class of .clearfix to force the
    height to be computed based on the tallest child
    element it contains.
